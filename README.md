# LetsGit

LetsGit is a git client located entirely in the cloud. Some of its target users are those who use computers without admin access (e.g. high school students) and designers who are working with developers but donâ€™t want to deal with installing and configuring git. LetsGit allows users to clone repositories from any git server, including github. Esoteric git commands are replaced with an easy to use, button-based GUI. LetsGit is free to use and is available at [http://LetsG.it/](http://letsg.it/).
